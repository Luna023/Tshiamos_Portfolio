          I am a passionate aspiring software developer with a foundation in
          Python, Java, C#, and web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
          My journey began at WeThinkCode_, where I gained hands-on experience
          in web development, data analysis, and quality assurance through
          project-based learning. During my time at WeThinkCode_, I developed 
          strong teamwork and communication skills through collaborative 
          projects and event volunteering. I excel in dynamic environments, 
          enjoy taking on challenges, and have a natural talent for problem-solving
          and troubleshooting. Passionate about web development and software testing, 
          I am eager to contribute to impactful projects while continuously improving 
          my skills and exploring new technologies.

            This is where my foundation in computers was built. I spent most of
            my time in the CAT class, where I learned about new computer
            features and developed my skills in HTML.I also served as a
            leadership prefect and actively participated in various cultural

          <h3>WeThinkCode_ Year 1</h3>
          <p>
            In my first year at WeThinkCode, I built a strong foundation in
            programming, learning essential concepts such as logic, data
            structures, and error handling. I also collaborated on a team
            project, developing a tool to automate a system. Moving towards a
            focus on object-oriented principles in Java, I gained a deeper
            understanding of key programming techniques and applied them in
            real-world projects, including building a client-server application.

          <p>
            In my second year at WeThinkCode, I enhanced my skills in
            Brownfields Development by working on an existing codebase,
            refactoring and adding new features, while gaining knowledge in
            CI/CD and automated testing. I also focused on web development,
            learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side rendering.
            Additionally, I took a QA elective, where I gained experience in GUI
            and API testing using C# and .NET.
